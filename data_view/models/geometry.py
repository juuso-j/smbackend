    Portions of the earthâ€™s surface may projected onto a two-dimensional, 
    or Cartesian, plane. Projected coordinate systems are especially convenient
    for region-specific applications, e.g., if you know that your database 
    will only cover geometries in North Kansas, then you may consider using 
    rojection system specific to that region. Moreover, projected coordinate 
    systems are defined in Cartesian units (such as meters or feet), easing 
    distance calculations.
